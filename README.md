# horrible-servers
Playground where I create horrible servers used in my blog posts. They are ment for testing only and should be considered as (very) unsafe.

## Disclaimer
These servers are created for educational purposes and are intended only for legal penetration testing and red teaming activities, where explicit permission has been granted. If you wish to test any of the scripts provided, please refer to [https://pampuna.nl/disclaimer](my disclaimer).

## Usage
I try to avoid using 3rd party packages in these servers. If one needed, a requirements.txt file is included.

## Blog
Go to my [Medium](https://medium.com/@pampuna) or [website](https://pampuna.nl) to see these servers in action.
