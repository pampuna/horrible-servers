# horrible-servers
Playground where I create horrible servers used in my blog posts. They are ment for testing only and are considered (very) unsafe.

## Usage
I try to avoid using 3rd party packages in these servers. If one needed, a requirements.txt file is included.

## Blog
Go to my [Medium](https://medium.com/@pampuna) or [website](https://pampuna.nl) to see these servers in action.
